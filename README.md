# emotionalpixels

Utilizing ml5's image segmentation and emotion detection algorithms, 
the emotionalpixels project detects the human face in front of the laptop camera.
Human can make a face expression that represents one of the 7 basic emotions (neutral, happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, disgusted),
and the program would sense the emotion energy radiating from that person's pixels 
and display the energy represented by 5 corresponding pixel emojis while treating the background as always neutral energy.
